# Introduction to Mathematical Cryptography - Notes & Implementations

This repository contains my study notes, exercise solutions, and Rust implementations of algorithms from the book "An Introduction to Mathematical Cryptography" by Hoffstein, Pipher, and Silverman.

Just a way to document my journey in learning about cryptography! :)
